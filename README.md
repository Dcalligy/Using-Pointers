# Exercise 3 Ch.13 Jumping Into C++
The problem is as followed: "Modify the program you wrote for exercise 1 so that instead of always prompting the user for a last name, it does so only if the caller passes in a NULL pointer for the last name."

The problem they are talking about is: "Write a function that prompts the user to enter his or her first name and last name, as two separate values. This function should return both values to the caller via additional pointer (or reference) parameters that are passed to the function. Try doing this first with pointers and then with references. (Hint: the function signature will look be similar to the swap function from earlier!)"
